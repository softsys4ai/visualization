# reusable_pretty_design
We use this repo to polish our ability in designing pretty diagrams for papers, posters, thesis and so on. We plan to do the practice and meet periodically. The resulting designs will be collected into appropriate libraries for future reuse.

Useful Resources:
1.   [TikZ and PGF](https://texample.net/) are TeX packages for creating graphics programmatically
2.   [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/) is a declarative statistical visualization library for Python, based on [Vega](http://vega.github.io/vega) and [Vega-Lite](http://vega.github.io/vega-lite), and the [source](http://github.com/altair-viz/altair) is available on GitHub.
